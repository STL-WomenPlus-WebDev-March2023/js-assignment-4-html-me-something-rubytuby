         <h1 id="mainHeading">Devolpment of Principality of Zeon Mobile Suits during the One&nbsp;Year&nbsp;War</h1>
      </header>
      <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">In 0079 of the Universal Century, mankind has spread to the stars in enourmous space colonies. Earlier the following year, the Principality of Zeon, a group of space colonies, declared independance from the Earth Federation, and tensions grew. This all came to a head when on January 3, 0079, Zeon drops a space colony on Earth, wiping out half of the total population of Earth, and the One Year War begins. It is during this time that military focus begins to shift away from standard combined arms fire, to instead focus entirely on the newest weapon of Zeon. Mobile&nbsp;Suits.&nbsp; </p>

         <h2>MS-06 Zaku II</h2>
         <p>The main workhorse of the Zeon army, the humble Zaku II is a beauty. Able to equip a wide variety of weapons, it is most commonly seen with a 120mm Machine Gun, a 280mm Zaku Bazooka, and a Heat Hawk for close combat. The Zaku II model is actually a series, full of one-offs that expand beyond the scope of this paper. However, the most famous model is undoubtedly the MS-06S Zaku II Commander Type, used to great effect by the Red Comet, Char Aznable.</p>

         <h2>MS-07B Gouf</h2>
         <p>After the success of the Zaku II line, Zeon decided to focus on a Earth-based, close-quarters combat design. The MS-07B Gouf features heavily improved speed, with new thruster units on a powerful new backpack and thrusters mounted on the legs for jumps, it's a powerhouse to be feared in urban settings. Featuring a 5 barrel 75mm Machine Gun in the left hand, a heat rod which could be used as a long range slicing tool or a grappling weapon with its powerful shocking effect, and a heat sword stored within its sheild, the Gouf is a monster in melee. A famous custom version of it, the MS-07B-3, built upon the success and shortcomings of the Gouf. Featuring a 75mm Gatling Gun mounted atop the shield, it shored up the Gouf's weakness in mid-range conflicts.</p>

         <h2>MS-09B Dom</h2>
         <p>With the Earth Federation desinging their own Mobile Suits, namely the massively advanced RX-78-2 Gundam, and the designs based upon it, the MS-09B Dom was built. Its defining feature were thermonuclear thrusters in the feet, allowing it to hover along the battlefield at cruising speeds of up to 381 km/h, with sensors in the legs allowing it do so even on uneven terrain. Heavily armored using a skirt like design, it was well protected in all vital areas, namely thrusters, as any loss of thrust would stop the Dom dead in its tracks. Its primary weapon is the 360mm Giant Bazooka, capable of sinking space cruisers with a single shot. Armed with a heat saber and a scattering beam cannon in its chest for close quarters engagements, it was not one to be taken lightly.</p>

         <h2>MS-14A Gelgoog</h2>
         <p>Nearing the end of the One Year War, Zeon sought to make one more mass-production Mobile Suit design, as the Zaku's by this point were heavily outdated. Unknowingly, it would be their last. The MS-14A Gelgoog was Zeon's attempt to make a mobile suit that could compete with the RX-78-2 Gundam. Utilizing data from the MS-06R Zaku II High Mobility Type and the MS-09R Rick Dom, the Gelgoog used beam technology, namely the twin beam saber, sometimes called a "beam naginata", and a beam rifle, the first for a Zeon Mobile Suit.</p>
